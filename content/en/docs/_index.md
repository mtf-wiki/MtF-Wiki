# Welcome

Welcome to the MtF Wiki. This is a place that may help some transgender women.

MtF (Male-to-Female), transgender female, refers to a female whose sex [^1] is male when she was born.

MtF Wiki is committed to becoming a free, open and continuously updated transgender knowledge integration site, where you can learn about all kinds of medicine knowledge, female common sense, and other things.

The current MtF Wiki is in its infancy. The various materials may not be complete, and there may even be some errors. Welcome all enthusiastic sisters to join us [^2] and contribute to the development of MtF Wiki.

As for the original intention of building this website, in addition to providing a knowledge platform for the majority of MtF groups, it is also eager for others to affirm the setting of gender conversion.

Many materials were referred to in the process of writing this project, and I would like to thank you.
